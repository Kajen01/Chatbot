# Chatbot
Floating Chatbot for my webpage.

The free chatbot by AI Chatting that can answer any question you may have.

It's user-friendly and easy to interact with, simply type your question and get a response.

The chatbot integrates with the OpenAI platform for generating responses, complemented by a default question-answer mechanism for handling common inquiries. When a user submits a message, the chatbot evaluates whether to respond using the OpenAI API or with a predefined default response.

GitHub's push protection is detecting the OpenAI API key in commits. This indicates that the sensitive data is present in your commit. so the API key is removed (respond using the OpenAI API is not working any more ðŸ˜’)
